## Welcome to My Project

This is a project that we originally did as homework. The instructor later showed us his technique for validating forms in Angular. For practice I will try to mimic his code and see if I can create a method for validating forms to use in future Angular projects.

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
- Run `gulp start` to start the server and a handful of other tasks

At the top of your `main.scss` file, just import any of the following:
